MCEBuddy 2.x

MCEBuddy - Remove Commercials and Ads, Convert Videos, Rename and Organize
your video collection for your Windows Media Center, Recorded TV and any Video.
Recommended by Jerra Buttitta of GCI Network Servies, OSS for good commercial
removal in March 26, 2015.  He runs it under windows.

Looks completely possible to run MCEBuddy under VMware player and win 7.
